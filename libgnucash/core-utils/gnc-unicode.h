/** @addtogroup Localization These functions perform string comparison
    and collation according to the Unicode Common Locale Data
    Repository rules. The CLDR specifies five levels of
    comparison.

    - The primary or base level considers all variant codepoints
    representing a character to be equivalent regardless of case or
    decorations like accents and vowel or tone marks.
    - The secondary level differentiates between letters with
    decorations but still ignores case.
    - The tertiary level differentiates based on case, decorations,
    and variants, for example A and â’¶.
    - The Quaternary level differentiates words with punctuation, for
    example "ab" and "a-b".
    - Identical differentiates all codepoints with no implicit
      normalization so a character constructed with combining marks
      will compare different from the same character represented as a
      single codepoint.
